		<h3>Dance Style</h3>
		<p>Bude Jive Club has a unique approach to teaching people to jive.</p>
		<p>We aim to preserve the 60's Traditional Rock 'n' Roll Jive style and to the music from the era.</p>
		<h4>Beginners</h4>
		<p>We encourage younger members to join the club and in order to keep their interest we build in modern jive moves in the routines taught.  This allows beginners to become more versatile and to develop routines that suit their individual ability.</p>
		<h4>Taking the Lead</h4>
		<p>Our Jive is a male lead dance and we encourage dancers to embrace the attitude and enthusiasm for Rock 'n' Roll as they did back in the 60's.</p>

		<h3>A Typical Monday Night</h3>
		<p>The hall is set out with various Rock 'n' Roll memorabilia by club members to create a warm and welcoming atmosphere.</p>
		<p>Classes run in the following order:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>7:30 - 8:15  Beginners</li>
			<li>8:15 - 8:45  Free Dance</li>
			<li>8:45 - 9:00  Intermediate</li>
			<li>9:00 - 10:00 Free Dance</li>
			</ul>
		<p>During beginner lessons the male members rotate to lead a variety of partners in order to gain wider experience.</p>
		<p>Teaching is led from the stage and this allows dancers to view the moves more clearly.</p>
		<p>Moves are broken down into small parts and repeated in order to aid learning.  There is a fun element to the sessions and we encourage people to relax and enjoy themselves.</p>
		<p>Cost: Â£35.00 for 10 weeks training</p>
